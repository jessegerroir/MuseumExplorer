# MusemExplorer

### This project is the prototype I built for my thesis for my Masters degree in HCI. 

The topic of my thesis was how to best visualize narratives of museum experiences. The development of the prototype invovled two main things:
1. Construct a virtual museum that would simulate a museum visit. 
2. Construct four different ways the user could create a data visulization of their virutal museum visit. 

After this, user testing was conducted and feedback was gathered regarding if the users preferred the visualization methods to more traditional methods, and what each visualization excelled at. The entire project had to be organized with HCI methodology in mind and all testing conducted with scientific rigour. The entire projected was documented in my thesis and I successfully defended it as a requirement of completing my degree.
