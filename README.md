# Musem Explorer

### This project is the prototype I built for my thesis for my Masters degree in HCI. 

The topic of my thesis was how to best visualize narratives of museum experiences. The development of the prototype invovled three main tasks:
1. Construct a virtual museum that would simulate a museum visit. 
2. Construct four different ways the user could create a data visulization of their virutal museum visit. 
3. Conduct user testing and analyze the results to see which of the four visulization was best and why.

Overall the entire project had to be organized with HCI methodology in mind and all testing conducted with scientific rigour. The entire projected was documented in my thesis and I successfully defended it as a requirement of completing my degree.
