Once they&amp;#39ve built up enough fat reserves, grizzlies look for a winter den. They may use a natural cave, a hollow fallen tree, or a hole dug in a well drained slope.

Does pondweed sound appetizing to you? Sodium rich water plants are a favourite food for moose, who will even dunk their whole heads underwater to reach them.
Having long legs has many advantages, moose can reach tall branches to nibble twigs, wade in water to gobble up 
aquatic plants, and walk in deep snow to find better feeding grounds.

Did you notice how large the moose&amp;#39s lips are? Strong and flexible, they&amp;#39re used to strip leaves from shrugs and trees.

Plants are generally low in calories and nutrients. So how does a moose keep its huge body running on such a diet? Quantity! Moose spend most of their time filling up their bellies, taking in up to 20 kilograms of food everyday.</column>

In a pack, wolves work as a group to catch large animals. When hoofed mammals are hard to find, wolves sometimes target smaller animals, such as beavers and hares.

Hunting is hard work, so wolves revisit a carcass until it&amp;#39s complete devoured. Scavenging animals such as foxes, wolverines and ravens also benefit, stealing unattended leftovers.

No need for shovels: caribou use their broad hooves to scoop up the snow that covers the ground lichen they like to eat in winter.

The name &amp;#39caribou&amp;#39 is believed to have come from the Mi&amp;#39kmaq word xalibu, &amp;#39meaning the animal who digs&amp;#39.
Caribou are covered in a thick coat of hollow guard hairs. Air pockets inside these hairs create an insulating layer that retains body heat. Caribou often have to cross wide rushing rivers that block their path. Luckily, they&amp;#39re excellent swimmers. Their wide hooves act like paddles, and their dense coat of hollow hairs helps them to stay afloat.


In winter, stiff hairs between the toes of the caribou grow into thick tufts that protect their fleshy footpads from the icy ground.

The meteorites, however, typically contain more iron than we find in rocks from the Earth&amp;#39s crust and mantle. The rest of the Earth&amp;#39s iron must therefore be deep under the surface.

Earth&amp;#39s gravity supports this idea. Based on materials that we find near the surface and in the mantle, Earth&amp;#39s gravity should be weaker. But if heavier materials such as iron are hidden at the core, then Earth&amp;#39s gravity makes sense.

            <column name="AdditionalInformation">Beavers are famously busy, and they turn their talents to reengineering the landscape as few other animals can. When sites are available, beavers burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes. But they also transform less suitable habitats by building dams. Felling and gnawing trees with their strong teeth and powerful jaws, they create massive log, branch, and mud structures to block streams and turn fields and forests into the large ponds that beavers love.

Domelike beaver homes, called lodges, are also constructed of branches and mud. They are often strategically located in the middle of ponds and can only be reached by underwater entrances. These dwellings are home to extended families of monogamous parents, young kits, and the yearlings born the previous spring.</column>

Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the pinnipeds being their closest living relatives. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets.</column>

In the fall the sheep move to their winter range a few kilometers away where the wind keeps the snow shallow and the sun warms south-facing slopes.  They will use the same migration routes for generations and return to the same protective cliffs to give birth to their lambs every year.

Dall's Sheep have long been prized for their delicious meat. First Nations would traditionally hunt sheep with bow and arrows or set snares along frequented travel routes. Sheep fleece was used to make blankets, jackets, and winter pants and horns used for ladles and dishes.</column>

            <column name="AdditionalInformation">The three main types, or classes, of rock are sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous and the differences among them have to do with how they are formed.

Sedimentary rocks are formed from particles of sand, shells, pebbles, and other fragments of material. Together, all these particles are called sediment. Gradually, the sediment accumulates in layers and over a long period of time hardens into rock. Generally, sedimentary rock is fairly soft and may break apart or crumble easily. You can often see sand, pebbles, or stones in the rock, and it is usually the only type that contains fossils.

Metamorphic rocks are formed under the surface of the earth from the metamorphosis (change) that occurs due to intense heat and pressure (squeezing). The rocks that result from these processes often have ribbonlike layers and may have shiny crystals, formed by minerals growing slowly over time, on their surface.

Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock deep within the earth) cools and hardens. Sometimes the magma cools inside the earth, and other times it erupts onto the surface from volcanoes (in this case, it is called lava). When lava cools very quickly, no crystals form and the rock looks shiny and glasslike. Sometimes gas bubbles are trapped in the rock during the cooling process, leaving tiny holes and spaces in the rock.

            <column name="AdditionalInformation">A meteorite is a solid piece of debris, from such sources as asteroids or comets, that originates in outer space and survives its impact with the Earth's surface. It is called a meteoroid before its impact. A meteorite's size can range from small to extremely large. When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere, friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate that energy, thus forming a fireball, also known as a meteor or shooting/falling star. A bolide is either an extraterrestrial body that collides with the Earth, or an exceptionally bright, fireball-like meteor regardless of whether it ultimately impacts the surface.</column>
